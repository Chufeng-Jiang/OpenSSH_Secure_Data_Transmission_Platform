The project is a Data Security Transmission Platform. It is similar to the account reconciliation between Apple pay and banks, where both parties recognize and authenticate each other. 

This is an infrastructure project that provides unified, standard information security services and has general components and business flows reasonably layered, subsystems are completely decoupled from each other, and Windows clients and Linux service programs are heterogeneously docked. 

The project uses concurrent server development, QT client development; and also has enterprise-level components: message encoding and decoding, Socket communication, IPC mechanism read-write. 

Here I used Oracle11g(best fit to Centos7) to store the information.
